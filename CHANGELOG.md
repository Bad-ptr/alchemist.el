# Changelog

## v0.4.0-dev

### Enhancements

  * Inform about no documentation for the current search in minibuffer.

    documentation for a given search term.
  * Improve loading time for documention by means of removing the temporary
    file for evaluation.
  * Simplify the search function for searching for the current `expression` under
    cursor position. `alchemist-help-search-at-point`
  * Add a project logo

### Deprecated

  * Mark `alchemist-help-sexp-at-point` and

    `alchemist-help-search-at-point` will adapt the functionality of both.
